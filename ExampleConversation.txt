 Not much, just hanging out at home. How about you?
DELANIE HENIFF
Same 
What do you look like 
ME
 Oh, I'm just a regular guy I guess. I have brown hair and brown eyes. I'm about average height and weight. What about you, what do you look like?
DELANIE HENIFF
Do you have a picture 
ME
 Yeah, I can send you a picture if you'd like. Do you have any particular interests or hobbies that you like to do in your free time? I'm always looking to meet new people and learn about different things.
DELANIE HENIFF
I like playing volleyball and going to the gym 
ME
Oh cool, I'm a big fan of sports too. I've always enjoyed playing basketball and football. Do you play any other sports or just volleyball?
DELANIE HENIFF
Nope just volleyball I’ve played for 7 years 
ME
Wow, that's really impressive. I've always admired people who are dedicated to a sport and put in the time and effort to get good at it. Do you play on a school team or a club team?
DELANIE HENIFF
I played for school until my sophomore year but have played club for ages but I took a break for my senior year and I’ll pick back up in college 
ME
Oh, that's cool. I've always enjoyed playing sports in school, but I never really had the dedication to stick with it long-term. Have you decided where you want to go to college yet, or are you still figuring it out?
DELANIE HENIFF
I’m going to university of Tampa 
ME
Wow, that's really cool. I've heard great things about the University of Tampa. What do you want to study in college? I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my future, so I'm always interested in hearing about what other people are passionate about.
DELANIE HENIFF
I’m majoring in nursing and maybe minoring in child development or something I don’t know yet but I want to become a neonatal/pediatric nurse
ME
Wow, that's really impressive. I've always admired people who are dedicated to helping others, and it sounds like nursing is a perfect fit for you. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to become a nurse, but it sounds like you have the drive and passion to succeed. Good luck with your studies and your future career!
DELANIE HENIFF
Thank you 
ME
No problem, I'm always happy to support and encourage others who are working towards their goals. So, what do you like to do for fun when you're not busy with school or volleyball? Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of those things?
DELANIE HENIFF
Just going to the gym
ME
Oh, that's cool. Staying active and healthy is always important. Do you have any specific goals or challenges that you're working towards at the gym? I'm always looking for ways to motivate myself and stay motivated, so I'm always interested in hearing about what other people are doing. Do you have any tips or advice for someone like me who's trying to get more into fitness?
DELANIE HENIFF
Um just have a clear mind set and know that some days will be harder but you just gotta push yourself and it’s gonna take a little to see progress 
ME
Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely keep that in mind. It can be tough to stay motivated sometimes, but it's important to remember that progress takes time and dedication. I'm sure you've seen a lot of progress in your own fitness journey, and it's inspiring to see someone who's dedicated and focused on their goals. Do you have any specific goals that you're working towards right now, or are you just trying to maintain your current level of fitness?
DELANIE HENIFF
Just keeping my current level 
ME
Oh, that's cool. It's definitely important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and not get too caught up in trying to reach specific goals all the time. Do you have any other hobbies or interests outside of volleyball and the gym? I'm always looking to meet new people and learn about different things, so I'm curious to know more about what makes you unique.
DELANIE HENIFF
Nope
